# Gravitational Billiard

In his short story "Anxiety is the Dizziness of Freedom", Ted Chiang cites physicist Michael Berry and states that the evolution of a pocket-less, friction-less billiard game is significantly influenced by a nearby standing player after nine collisions.

In this simulation, two identical shots are propagated in time; once with and once without the gravitational influence of an 80kg person standing next to the table. 

The two simulations are displayed on top of each other. The two results differ significantly after about 70 individual collisions (ball-ball and ball-band).
